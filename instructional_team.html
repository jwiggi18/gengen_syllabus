  <h2 style="width:100%">Dr. Jodie Wiggins
  </h2>
  <p> Dr. Wiggins completed her B.Sc. in Animal Science in 2003, after which she
    wondered aimlessly for a while, having discovered she didn't actually want to
    be a veterinarian. She worked for an attorney for a bit and found that to not be quite challenging enough. She worked trying
    to sell children's clothing at Children's Place for a bit (turns out retail is super duper not her thing), worked at
    Hallmark trying to sell people random junk they didn't need for a bit (did I mention the whole 'terrible at retail' thing?)
    and then had the good fortune be invited to serve as a long-term substitute in
    a Jr. High sciences class. Here, she discovered that she loved teaching science.
    She went back to school to earn her teacher certification and taught Jr. High
    and elementary science for several years but, she found she needed the intellectual challenge of working in science, in addition to teaching it.</p>

    <p>She thus returned to school once more to pursue her master's in biology.
      Alas, she had found her place. She taught science, reworking labs and even being
      invited to serve as a lecturer as a master's student, while sating her intellectual
      thirst through research into a chromosomal hybrid zone. During her master's
      she welcomed her second child and
      married her husband (the other Dr. Wiggins).</p>

      <p>Upon the completion of her masters she entered a PhD program to study
        evolutionary biology.
        Shortly thereafter, her youngest child died. She descended into
        the bleakest, darkest
        depression of her life. She developed PTSD and was certain she
        would never care about
        science or teaching or learning or anything ever again.</p>

        <p>Something around 2 years later, having experienced some healing of her grief by the
          birth of her third son and with the encouragement of her husband and advisor,
          she returned to graduate school. She found great solace in her first loves,
          science and teaching. She struggled and failed, a lot. She sat on the rocks of her
          field site and cried, often. She wondered if any of this really even mattered (and sometimes still does) but
          the peace she felt when immersed in her data and the joy she saw when her students
          grasped concepts kept her going. She successfully defended her dissertation in July
          of 2018 and became "Dr. Wiggins." </p>

          <p>Since that monumental accomplishment she's failed a lot and cried a lot. She's also
            deepened her research into sexual selection and sex chromosome evolution in
            Collared lizards, developed and conducted educator workshops on evolution education,
            and become an assistant teaching professor at Oklahoma State University. This year
          marks her 15th as a science educator and 12th as a researcher. </p>
