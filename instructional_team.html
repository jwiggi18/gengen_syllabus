  <h2 style="width:100%">Dr. Jodie Wiggins
  </h2>
  <p> Dr. Wiggins completed her B.Sc. in Animal Science in 2003, after which she
    wondered aimlessly for a while, having discovered she didn't actually want to
    be a veterinarian. She worked for an attorney for a bit (boring), worked trying
    to sell children's clothing at Children's Place for a bit (boring), worked at
    Hallmark trying to sell people random junk they didn't need for a bit (boring)
    and then had the good fortune be invited to serve as a long-term substitute in
    a Jr. High sciences class. Here, she discovered that she loved teaching science.
    She went back to school to earn her teacher certification and taught Jr. High
    and elementary science for several years but, guess what? She got bored... (shocking!)</p>

    <p>She thus returned to school once more to pursue her master's in biology.
      Alas, she had found her place. She taught science, reworking labs and even being
      invited to serve as a lecturer as a master's student, while sating her intellectual
      thirst through research into a chromosomal hybrid zone. During her master's
      she welcomed her second child and
      married her husband (the other Dr. Wiggins).</p>

      <p>Upon the completion of her masters she entered a PhD program to study
        evolutionary biology.
        Shortly thereafter, her youngest child died. She descended into
        the bleakest, darkest
        depression of her life. She developed PTSD and was certain she
        would never care about
        science or teaching or learning or anything ever again.</p>

        <p>Something around 2 years later, having experienced some healing of her grief by the
          birth of her third son and with the encouragement of her husband and advisor,
          she returned to graduate school. She found great solace in her first loves,
          science and teaching. She struggled and failed, a lot. She sat on the rocks of her
          field site and cried, often. She wondered if any of this really even mattered but
          the peace she felt when immersed in her data and the joy she saw when her students
          grasped concepts kept her going. She successfully defended her dissertation in July
          of 2018 and became "Dr. Wiggins." </p>

          <p>Since that monumental accomplishment she's failed a lot and cried a lot. She's also
            deepened her research into sexual selection and sex chromosome evolution in
            Collared lizards, developed and conducted educator workshops on evolution education,
            and become an assistant teaching professor at Oklahoma State University. This year
          marks her 13th as a science educator and 10th as a researcher. </p>

  <p> Austin Leone is a PhD Candidate in the Integrative Biology PhD program at OSU, and graduating with his PhD this May!
  Genetics is one of his favorite subjects to teach, but he also has experience teaching introductory biology, other life
  science courses for pre-service teachers, and geology & general biology courses abroad in Southeast Asia. This spring
  marks his 8th semester helping teach a genetics course in his graduate career. His award-winning research investigates
  how communicating science on research posters relates to people seeing themselves as scientists. In his spare time, he
  loves playing with his corgi, Pluto, balancing fitness with his love for cooking, and planning costume ideas for
  Halloween (his favorite holiday). </p>

  <h2 style="width:100%"> Tyler Spresser
  </h2>
  <p> I am fourth year PhD student working with honeybees and native bees. More specifically how the nutrition of the pollen
  collected by bees changes based on landscape composition and how this composition effects a specific innate immune
  pathway that uses reactive nitrogen species to eliminate threats. I spend a lot of my time reading, watching moving, or
  playing with my dog Oscar. Oscar is a double Merle border collie, this means he was born with a genetic mutation that
  caused him to be born deaf. In a lot of cases double Merles are born deaf, blind, or both and are predominately white in
  coloration. He also has two more genetic disorders one causes him to hallucinate imaginary flies and the other is due to
  a genetic mutation similar in humans that causes crones disease. </p>

      </h2>
      <p> Molly is a recent alumna of Oklahoma State University! She graduated in May of 2021 with a B.S. in Biology and a
      minor in child development. She fell in love with research during her senior year of college, and was co-mentored by Dr.
      Elizabeth McCullagh and Dr. Jodie Wiggins studying brain anatomy and sound processing of green tree frogs. In addition
      to science and research, she also loved doing Greek Shows (Spring Sing being her favorite).
      Since graduation, Molly has been applying to dental schools for the second year in a row. In December, she was accepted
      into the OU College of Dentistry to pursue her Doctor of Dental Surgery degree! She plans to work as a pediatric dentist,
      and to provide treatment for children with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities by creating a traveling dental
      van. In her free time, she loves to cook, go hiking, listen to live music, and travel with her friends and family! </p>
