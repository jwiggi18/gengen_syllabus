  <h2 style="width:100%">Dr. Jodie Wiggins
  </h2>
  <p> Dr. Wiggins completed her B.Sc. in Animal Science in 2003, after which she
    wondered aimlessly for a while, having discovered she didn't actually want to
    be a veterinarian. She worked for an attorney for a bit (boring), worked trying
    to sell children's clothing at Children's Place for a bit (boring), worked at
    Hallmark trying to sell people random junk they didn't need for a bit (boring)
    and then had the good fortune be invited to serve as a long-term substitute in
    a Jr. High sciences class. Here, she discovered that she loved teaching science.
    She went back to school to earn her teacher certification and taught Jr. High
    and elementary science for several years but, guess what? She got bored... (shocking!)</p>

    <p>She thus returned to school once more to pursue her master's in biology.
      Alas, she had found her place. She taught science, reworking labs and even being
      invited to serve as a lecturer as a master's student, while sating her intellectual
      thirst through research into a chromosomal hybrid zone. During her master's
      she welcomed her second child and
      married her husband (the other Dr. Wiggins).</p>

      <p>Upon the completion of her masters she entered a PhD program to study
        evolutionary biology.
        Shortly thereafter, her youngest child died. She descended into
        the bleakest, darkest
        depression of her life. She developed PTSD and was certain she
        would never care about
        science or teaching or learning or anything ever again.</p>

        <p>Something around 2 years later, having experienced some healing of her grief by the
          birth of her third son and with the encouragement of her husband and advisor,
          she returned to graduate school. She found great solace in her first loves,
          science and teaching. She struggled and failed, a lot. She sat on the rocks of her
          field site and cried, often. She wondered if any of this really even mattered but
          the peace she felt when immersed in her data and the joy she saw when her students
          grasped concepts kept her going. She successfully defended her dissertation in July
          of 2018 and became "Dr. Wiggins." </p>

          <p>Since that monumental accomplishment she's failed a lot and cried a lot. She's also
            deepened her research into sexual selection and sex chromosome evolution in
            Collared lizards, developed and conducted educator workshops on evolution education,
            and become an assistant teaching professor at Oklahoma State University. This year
          marks her 13th as a science educator and 10th as a researcher. </p>

  </h2>
  <p> Austin Leone is a PhD Candidate in the Integrative Biology PhD program at OSU, and graduating with his PhD this May!
  Genetics is one of his favorite subjects to teach, but he also has experience teaching introductory biology, other life
  science courses for pre-service teachers, and geology & general biology courses abroad in Southeast Asia. This spring
  marks his 8th semester helping teach a genetics course in his graduate career. His award-winning research investigates
  how communicating science on research posters relates to people seeing themselves as scientists. In his spare time, he
  loves playing with his corgi, Pluto, balancing fitness with his love for cooking, and planning costume ideas for
  Halloween (his favorite holiday). </p>
