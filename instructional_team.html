  <h2 style="width:100%">Dr. Jodie Wiggins
  </h2>
  <p> Dr. Wiggins completed her B.Sc. in Animal Science in 2003, after which she
    wondered aimlessly for a while, having discovered she didn't actually want to
    be a veterinarian. She worked for an attorney for a bit (boring), worked trying
    to sell children's clothing at Children's Place for a bit (boring), worked at
    Hallmark trying to sell people random junk they didn't need for a bit (boring)
    and then had the good fortune be invited to serve as a long-term substitute in
    a Jr. High sciences class. Here, she discovered that she loved teaching science.
    She went back to school to earn her teacher certification and taught Jr. High
    and elementary science for several years but, guess what? She got bored... (shocking!)</p>

    <p>She thus returned to school once more to pursue her master's in biology.
      Alas, she had found her place. She taught science, reworking labs and even being
      invited to serve as a lecturer as a master's student, while sating her intellectual
      thirst through research into a chromosomal hybrid zone. During her master's
      she welcomed her second child and
      married her husband (the other Dr. Wiggins).</p>

      <p>Upon the completion of her masters she entered a PhD program to study
        evolutionary biology.
        Shortly thereafter, her youngest child died. She descended into
        the bleakest, darkest
        depression of her life. She developed PTSD and was certain she
        would never care about
        science or teaching or learning or anything ever again.</p>

        <p>Something around 2 years later, having experienced some healing of her grief by the
          birth of her third son and with the encouragement of her husband and advisor,
          she returned to graduate school. She found great solace in her first loves,
          science and teaching. She struggled and failed, a lot. She sat on the rocks of her
          field site and cried, often. She wondered if any of this really even mattered but
          the peace she felt when immersed in her data and the joy she saw when her students
          grasped concepts kept her going. She successfully defended her dissertation in July
          of 2018 and became "Dr. Wiggins." </p>

          <p>Since that monumental accomplishment she's failed a lot and cried a lot. She's also
            deepened her research into sexual selection and sex chromosome evolution in
            Collared lizards, developed and conducted educator workshops on evolution education,
            and become an assistant teaching professor at Oklahoma State University. This year
          marks her 13th as a science educator. </p>

  </h2>
  <p> Yetkin Ipek is a PhD student in the Integrative Biology department at OSU.
    This will be his 2nd semester teaching Genetics; while his previous teaching
    experiences also include teaching the Introductory Biology course for 4 semesters.
    After getting his BSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics, his studies focused on Earth
    System Sciences, Ecology and Limnology. He is currently investigating the effects
    of different nutrients on Harmful Algal Blooms and how different anthropogenic
    activities affect water quality by causing bloom formations. He spends his free time
    cycling, playing video games, or reading/watching anything and everything related
    to the Lord of the Rings. </p>

  </h2>
  <p> Austin Leone is a PhD Candidate in the Integrative Biology PhD program at OSU.
    Genetics is one of his favorite subjects to teach, but he also has experience teaching
    introductory biology, life science courses for pre-service teachers, and geology &
    general biology courses abroad in Southeast Asia. This spring marks his 7th semester
    helping teach a genetics course in his graduate career. His research investigates how
    people communicate science (presentations, research posters, etc.) and how it relates
    to people seeing themselves as scientists. In his fleeting spare time, he loves playing
    with his corgi, Pluto, balancing fitness with his love for cooking, and planning costume
    ideas for Halloween (his favorite holiday). </p>

  <h2 style="width:100%"> Tyler Spresser
  </h2>
  <p> Tyler Spresser is a PhD student in Integrative Biology. This is Tylers first time teaching genetics, however, he does have a research background in biochemistry, which is a subject that goes hand and hand with genetics. He has taught introductory biology here at OSU, and organismal and cell biology and animal biology at the university that he did his masters at. Tylers research focus is in nutritional biochemistry and a new innovative field of nutritional immunology. He studies honey bees and native bees and how the nutrition of the pollen that they collect plays a role in the cellular mechanisms used for development and for innate immunology. Tyler has lived here in Oklahoma for about 3 years now, and in those three years he adopted two dogs, one with his partner, Kevin, (he is bridled boxer mix, named Dexter) the other is an almost white double Merle border collie that is special needs, named Oscar. He suffers from two genetic defects one, is the double Merle gene. This gene controls the coat color and when they receive two recessive types of this gene it has a 25% chance it can make the dog deaf and/or blind. This gene controls coats color, hearing and sight. Oscar, also suffers from a very rare seizure disorder, known as fly catching syndrome. Sounding really farfetched, these seizures cause him to hallucinate flies, causing him to chase them and snap at the air to try to "catch" them. He is the only dog in this area that suffers from it, that has been diagnosed. </p>
