        <h3> Homework </h3>
        <hr>
          <p>Every week you will have a homework assignment that reenforces the concepts covered that week and integrates concepts from the previous weeks. The homework will be due Wednesday by 11:59pm each week. </p>
          <br>
          <p>There are 7 homework assignments, each worth 100 points. Each student's lowest homework grade will be dropped. Homework accounts for a total of 600 course points</p>
          <br>
          <p>You may discuss your questions and answers with anyone you wish, and you may use any resources, but every single sentence must be written in your own words. Any answer that contains material not written in your own words will earn zero points.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>You will have the opportunity to dissect one question from each homework assignment for full credit. For details see homework dissection below.
          </p>

          <hr>
            <h4> Homework Dissection </h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Upon receiving your graded homework you may select one question that was marked incorrect or incomplete to dissect for up to full question credit.
</p>
            <p>Your dissected question must</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>Be included at the end of the next weekâ€™s homework submission on Canvas
</p></li>
              <li><p>Include the correct answer in your own words (the key will have been posted at this point)
</p></li>
              <li><p>Include a screenshot of the graded question, including your initial answer and any grader comments/notations</p></li>
              <li><p>Explain clearly and in detail what about your answer was incorrect or incomplete
</p></li>
              <li><p>Explain clearly and in detail what about the correct answer is different than your initial answer and how it correctly or more fully answers the question.
</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The submission of a dissected answer does not guarantee points earned.
</p>
          <h4> Dissections submitted without all of the above elements will not be graded.

            <p>Each instructional video contains embedded learning questions. These are designed to highlight important points and ensure you are engaged. *Important note: just because a concept does not have an accompanying embedded learning question this does not mean it is unimportant or will not be tested.

            <hr>
            <p>The majority of this course is asynchronous. You have your learning materials and assignments and may complete them in any way that works for you as long as they are completed prior to the deadline. Small group meetings are synchronous. You must attend at your scheduled meeting time. You must participate in small group meetings. Attendance and participation in small group meetings is worth 50 points per week. There are 8 instructional weeks in the semester. </p>
            <br>
            <p>You will determine if you met the criteria for each small group meeting and will complete a meeting declaration each week.
              For each of that week's meeting criteria you will answer either "true" that you met the criteria or "false" that you did not.</p>
