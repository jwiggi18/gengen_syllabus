        <h3> Homework </h3>
        <hr>
          <p>Every week you will have a homework assignment that reenforces the concepts covered that week and integrates concepts from the previous weeks. The homework will be due Wednesday by 11:59pm each week. </p>
          <br>
          <p>There are 14 homework assignments, each worth 100 points</p>
          <br>
          <p>You may discuss your questions and answers with anyone you wish, and you may use any resources, but every single sentence must be written in your own words. Any answer that contains material not written in your own words will earn zero points.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>You will have the opportunity to dissect one question from each homework assignment for full credit. For details see “homework” in appendix.
          </p>

          <hr>
            <h4> Homework Dissection </h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Upon receiving your graded homework you may select one question that was marked incorrect or incomplete to dissect for up to full question credit.
</p>
            <p>Your dissected question must</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>Be included at the end of the next week’s homework submission on Canvas
</p></li>
              <li><p>Include the correct answer in your own words (the key will have been posted at this point)
</p></li>
              <li><p>Include a screenshot of the graded question, including your initial answer and any grader comments/notations</p></li>
              <li><p>Explain clearly and in detail what about your answer was incorrect or incomplete
</p></li>
              <li><p>Explain clearly and in detail what about the correct answer is different than your initial answer and how it correctly or more fully answers the question.
</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The submission of a dissected answer does not guarantee points earned.
</p>
          <h4> Dissections submitted without all of the above elements will not be graded.
 </h4>

            <hr>
            <p>Each instructional video contains embedded learning questions. These are designed to highlight important points and ensure you are engaged. *Important note: just because a concept does not have an accompanying embedded learning question this does not mean it is unimportant or will not be tested.
</p>
            <br>
            <p>
Embedded learning questions are worth a total of 50 points each week.

            <h3> Small Group Meetings </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The majority of this course is asynchronous. You have your learning materials and assignments and may complete them in any way that works for you as long as they are completed prior to the deadline. Small group meetings are synchronous. You must attend at your scheduled meeting time. You must have a webcam that is on and you must participate in small group meetings. Attendance and participation in small group meetings is worth 50 points per week. There are 15 instructional weeks in the semester. You must attend 12 meetings to earn full credit (600 points for the semester). </p>
            <br>
            <p>You will determine if you met the criteria for each small group meeting and will complete a meeting declaration each week. For each of that week's meeting criteria you will answer either "true" that you met the criteria or "false" that you did not.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Small groups will meet weekly with the following exceptions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Week of Jan 18 - No Monday meetings</li>
                <li>Week of Feb 1 - No Wednesday meetings</li>
                <li>Week of Apr 12 - No Tuesday meetings</li>
              </ul>
              <img src="img/sg_schedule.jpg" style="width:100%">
            <br>
            <p>Below you can find the name of your group leader. The week of 01/18 your group leader will message you via CANVAS with meeting information.

All subsequent communications should occur through SLACK.</p>
